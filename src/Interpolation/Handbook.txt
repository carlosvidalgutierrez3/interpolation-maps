This is to obtain the example portrayed on the CDR presentation slides:

- Open MATLAB on the directory Interpolation/IDW
- the file 'BSinfo_2.csv' is given to us by data adquisition. It is a list of pollution values of BS in Europe.
- the file 'a2.csv' is the grid.
- Execute:
	cat = IDW_square_area()
- The output "cat.csv" is saved and will be used for representation by Joel (Display).

How to build the grid (this will not be on the server):
- Open MATLAB on the directory Interpolation/GeneratePositionValues
- Execute:
	M = kml2format();
	a2 = generate_positions(M);
- The grid will be saved in csv in the current folder.
